/**
 * The seed of a run, from the bar to the address bar and back.
 *
 * `src/app/app.test.ts` proves all of this against a jsdom document, which is
 * enough for the wiring. What it cannot prove is the part that belongs to the
 * browser: that a real anchor with a hash `href` navigates, that navigating
 * fires `hashchange` rather than reloading, and that the router hears it. Those
 * three are the whole mechanism by which a player pins a run, and jsdom
 * implements each of them approximately.
